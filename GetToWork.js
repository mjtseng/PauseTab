//javascript for desktop notifications

/*

the following code was copied and pasted from Eunoia (https://github.com/VTam25/Eunoia/blob/master/s1.js)
I switched out the words and kept the syntax. I also deleted some unnecessary whitespace.
This code should be carefully reviewed before being finalized.

var options= 	//what does this mean? what is var? TO DO: find out.
{
	type:"basic",
	title:"Stop procrastinating!",
	message:"It's time to stop procrastinating! Get to work, or take a mental break", //to do: revise this advice to be helpful
	iconUrl:"./assets/notification.png" //there is currently no icon created for PauseTab. When made, it'll be placed in "assets"
										//not sure if I'm going to redesign the logo. If I do, I'll make sure the new one's here
										//It's also possible to have a different icon for the notification (non-logo)
};

chrome.notifications.create(options, callback);
	console.log("Popup done!");

function callback(){

}
