    <!--TO-DOS: (starred = important)-->
    <!-- check the syntax for linking a script -->
    <!-- actually learn how to manage tabs within an extension -->
	<!-- also remember this is for Chrome, not Firefox -->
	<!-- *keep up your Github streak with actual coding and not just commenting -->
		<!-- update: broke the Github streak (-_-) Gotta pay more attention to code, I guess. -->
	<!-- learn how to manage time better to have more coding time; also procrastinate less on projects :/ -->
		<!-- I find it sad that I'm not coding as much as before, but I also have a paper today. Will code later I guess -->

    <!--FEATURES:-->
    <!-- to decide: is this going to be more anti-procrastination or a tab manager? [IMPORTANT] -->
    <!-- I think scripts go somewhere around here? -->
    <!-- the notification script stuff should be linked somehow?? -->
    	<!-- about that script: if you want to include an image, you have to declare it in manifest.json.
    	See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/desktop_notifications for details -->
    <!-- Searching through tabs should also be a thing -->
    <!-- incorporating Python? (just seems like it could be cool b/c I have to learn Python for Beaver Works anyway) -->

    <!--UI/DESIGN:-->
    <!-- probably will be clean and modern, more like Firefox Quantum's Photon design than whatever Chrome does -->
	<!-- a script to maybe change the colors of the tabs according to folder? So color-coding? -->

    	<!--IDEA (maybe not to put in popup.html)
			- Bundling tabs together.
			- E.g. if you want to have a bunch of wikipedia tabs together, they can be compressed into wikipedia.org/ [two different things]
			- Related: you might also want to have folders. (They could be useful for dividing into work, research, procrastination, etc.)
