        <ul>
		    a horizontal navbar you could implement (format copied from MemePage repo, can be adapted here):
		    <li>Navbar text:</li>
		    <li> <a href="#PlaceOne">Go to Place One</a> </li>
		    <li> <a href="linktwo.html">Go to Link Two</a> </li>
		    <maybe add more pages here, I mean I don't know>
        </ul>
    -->
    
    <!--IDEA (maybe not to put in index.html)
		- Bundling tabs together.
		- E.g. if you want to have a bunch of wikipedia tabs together, they can be compressed into wikipedia.org/ [two different things]
		- Related: you might also want to have folders. (They could be useful for dividing into work, research, procrastination, etc.)
