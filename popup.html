    <!--TO-DOS (and other updates): (starred = important)-->
    <!-- learn like everything necessary for the javascript things / in-page notifications -->
    <!-- actually learn how to manage tabs within an extension -->
	<!-- also remember this is for Chrome, not Firefox (plebes! Firefox Quantum is the superior browser) -->
	<!-- *keep up your Github streak with actual coding and not just commenting -->
		<!-- tbh too lazy to code now b/c I'm on vacation. procrastination is the worst tho -->
	<!-- learn how to manage time better to have more coding time; also procrastinate less on projects :/ -->
		<!-- so, today I deleted some more old comments and I guess I should delete the rest later?
		I want to do some stuff in the javascript later and make a real notification too, but I have hw today ;-; -->
		<!-- update: so uhhh Weird Al videos have proved to be a real distraction, but I highly recommend them
		quality music too -->

    <!--FEATURES:-->
    <!--GENERAL:-->
    <!-- to decide: is this going to be more anti-procrastination or a tab manager? [IMPORTANT] -->
    <!-- I think scripts go somewhere around here? -->
    <!-- the notification script stuff should be linked somehow?? -->
    	<!-- about that script: if you want to include an image, you have to declare it in manifest.json.
    	See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/desktop_notifications for details -->
    <!-- incorporating Python? (just seems like it could be cool b/c I have to learn Python for Beaver Works anyway) -->
    <!--TAB MANAGER-->
    	<!-- Searching through tabs should also be a thing -->
    <!--ANTI-PROCRASTINATION-->
    	<!-- like an alarm thing or something -->
    	<!-- notifications on the hour or when set by user ,etc. -->

    <!--UI/DESIGN:-->
    <!-- probably will be clean and modern, more like Firefox Quantum's Photon design than whatever Chrome does -->
	<!-- a script to maybe change the colors of the tabs according to folder? So color-coding? -->
	<!-- I mean I might change the logo, idk tho b/c it looks like work lol 
	also I have to make the image for the notifications, gotta have something witty or cool there -->
	<!-- hey look you can put emojis in here! this extension is gonna be ðŸ”¥ -->
    	<!-- could probably put one in the notification too lol -->

				}
				// I don't really understand this line but I think it gets and prints txt ?? idk
				document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = txt;

    	<!--IDEA (maybe not to put in popup.html)
			- Bundling tabs together.
			- E.g. if you want to have a bunch of wikipedia tabs together, they can be compressed into wikipedia.org/ [two different things]
			- Related: you might also want to have folders. (They could be useful for dividing into work, research, procrastination, etc.)
